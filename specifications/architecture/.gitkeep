# Architecture Documents

This directory contains high-level architecture documents for the Custom Monopoly project.

Documents here should describe:
- System overview and context
- Major subsystems and their interactions
- Technology stack decisions and rationale
- Deployment and runtime architecture
- Cross-cutting concerns

Use diagrams liberally to communicate complex relationships.
